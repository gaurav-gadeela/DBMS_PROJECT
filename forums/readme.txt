DBMS PROJECT:

our project is a forums website for different programming languages where people can ask questions,comment and answer the questions regarding the programming languages.
we have created a login page for the users to login and also a signup page for people who have not yet registered.
the people who have not registered can view the questions but cannot comment and answer on the questions.
once you have logged in, it shows that you are loggen in by (welcome admin) on top right and there is also a logout button which the users can you use to logout of the website.
there is a home page which is interactive and shows the list of all the available programming languages.
there is an about page which shows the details and the creators of the website.
there is categories scroll page which contains all the categories rather all the programming languages directly which can be accessed.
there is a contact page which the users can use to contact the site in case if any trouble occured to them or if they have any queries.
there is also a dialog box and a search button where you can directly type your required question.
